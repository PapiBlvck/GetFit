## ðŸš§ TOP 5 CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

### 1. Button Click Events Not Working
- **Problem:** Goals buttons unresponsive
- **Root Cause:** CSS `::before` pseudo-element blocking clicks
- **Solution:** Added `pointer-events: none` to pseudo-element
- **Lesson:** CSS layers affect JavaScript events

### 2. Firebase Authentication Errors
- **Problem:** Confusing `auth/invalid-credential` errors
- **Root Cause:** Users trying to login without account
- **Solution:** Enhanced error messages, added signup hints, improved validation
- **Lesson:** Clear communication = better UX

### 3. Dashboard Stats Not Updating
- **Problem:** Showing hardcoded data instead of user data
- **Root Cause:** Missing data binding and update functions
- **Solution:** Added `data-stat` attributes, created `updateDashboardStats()`, connected Firebase
- **Lesson:** Data flow must be explicit in vanilla JS

### 4. Sidebar Showing on Auth Pages
- **Problem:** Navigation visible before login
- **Root Cause:** No conditional rendering
- **Solution:** Dynamic visibility in `showView()`, smooth transitions
- **Lesson:** UI state should match app state

### 5. Generic Alert Dialogs
- **Problem:** Browser alerts breaking design consistency
- **Root Cause:** Using native `alert()` and `confirm()`
- **Solution:** Built custom toast (4 types) and modal systems, replaced 20+ alerts
- **Lesson:** Custom components = professional experience
